# Introduction 

Welcome to the Canarytools API Documentation.

If you're new here, take a look at our [Getting Started](guide/getting-started) section which will walk you through finding your API key, determining your Console's unique domain, and making your first calls to the API.

For FAQs, step-by-step Bird and Console setup instructions, and other support issues, head on over to our [Help Page](https://help.canary.tools/).

If you have any support related issues that you haven't been able to find an answer to, please feel free to [drop us a mail](mailto:support@canary.tools). We're always happy to answer your questions.
